Today, I'm chatting with Cecily Walker, a Librarian II at [Vancouver Public Library](http://www.vpl.ca/) and an Editorial Board member at [In the Library with the Lead Pipe](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/).

<h3>In this episode</h3>

We talked about thinking like a programmer, Skillcrush, Maptime, learning communities, why maybe user interfaces _should_ make you think, the gaps in our metadata, human stories, and how to break and remake the library world for the better. I couldn't have asked for a better opening guest.
