<h3>In this episode</h3>

Telecommuting via robot; how Francis got into system administration (and library school) by way of a Kenyan computer club and his dormmates' advice; late '90s computer science curricula and why things are better now; why Docker is the new hotness (and containerization can make your life than virtual machines do); learning from your social circle; documentation as hospitality; what Francis' favorite operating system is and why (spoiler alert: it's the one that makes him swear the least); and administering lots of servers at once with an Ansible playbook.
